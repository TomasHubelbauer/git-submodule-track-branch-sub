# `git-submodule-track-branch` submodule

This repository doesn't stand on its own.
It is used as a submodule in https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/git-submodule-track-branch.
Refer to that repository to learn about the purpose of this submodule repository.

As a part of the work I am doing in the main repository, I will need to make changes here.
Everything below this paragraph is a scratch area for making changes and commits for tests.
